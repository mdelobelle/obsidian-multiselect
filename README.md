## Description
This plugin leverages the great Dataview plugin capabilities to select multiple values returned by a query and include them in your note

You can beta-test it with BRAT: `mdelobelle/obsidian-multiselect/`

for example
- select some [[<ingredient>]] from your '#Ingredient' notes as required ingredients for a recipe
- select some of your [[<teamate>]] from your '#Staff' notes as participants for a meeting note
- select some [[<song>]] from your '#Favorite && #Song' notes as songs for a playlist note
and so on...

Seing all the links related to a query helps selecting them faster and not forgetting some.

You'll have to set a name, a description and the query.
The query has to be written in the dataviewjs syntax: https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/intro/ and has to return a dataArray
